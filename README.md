# tech-challenge

This repo holds the code for a technical challenge. 

To get running locally, clone this repo (MASTER BRANCH) and: 
1. run ```npm install```
2. you may need to run ```npm install ```
2. run ```npm use node```
3. make sure PostGres is running on localhost and create a local database using your preferred application (I used PGAdmin) 
4. edit the *package.json* file's 'name' to reflect the name of this database
5. run ```npm run start```

*If you get **concurrently** errors, install module globally*
